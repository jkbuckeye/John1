				<h2> John's Personal Bio </h2>
				<p> I'm born and raised in Minneapolis, MN, and while I like to travel, I truly believe there

				have adventures. </p>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2> John's Professional Bio </h2>
				<p> I consider myself a communications specialist. I did loan servicing at Wells Fargo, before
				I left and took on writing articles, as well as <em>doing research and content-writing.</em> Currently,
