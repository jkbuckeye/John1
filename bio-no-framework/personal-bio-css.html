			<section class="personal-bio">
				<h2> John's Personal Bio </h2>
				<p> I'm born and raised in Minneapolis, MN, and while I like to travel, I truly believe there
				is no place I'd rather live. I like to play sports, create things, interact with people and
				have adventures. </p>
			</section>
			<section class="pro-bio">
				<h2> John's Professional Bio </h2>
				<p> I consider myself a communications specialist. I did loan servicing at Wells Fargo, before
				I left and took on writing articles, as well as <em>doing research and content-writing.</em> Currently,
				I'm serving in Americorps in the MN Reading Corps </p>
